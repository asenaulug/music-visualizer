# music-visualizer
A music visualizer which displays the real time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of music on an RGB LED matrix

By Cynthia Zelga, Asena Ulug, and Jocelyn Gilbert

Our ECE 4760 final project is a music visualizer which displays the real time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of music on an RGB LED matrix. Our motivation for this project was to create a fun and aesthetically-pleasing way of displaying music. Additionally, our music visualizer provides an alternate avenue for experiencing music for those that are deaf or hard of hearing.
